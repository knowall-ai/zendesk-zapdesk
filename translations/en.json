This wallet-agnostic solution provides a frictionless tipping experience that benefits both customers and support teams.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **Lightning Network Integration**: Fast, low-fee Bitcoin payments using Lightning addresses\n- **QR Code Support**: Easy mobile wallet scanning with BOLT11 and LNURL-pay protocols\n- **Configurable Tip Amounts**: Pre-set tip values (100, 1,000, 10,000 sats) with custom amount support\n- **Personal Messages**: Customers can include thank-you messages with their tips\n- **Flexible Visibility**: Admins control whether tip notifications appear as public comments or internal notes\n- **No Custody**: End-users pay directly from their own wallets - Zapdesk never holds funds\n- **Agent Control**: Each agent configures their own Lightning address in their Zendesk profile\n\n**Privacy & Data Handling**\n\nZapdesk is committed to protecting user privacy and data security:\n\n- **No Data Collection**: The app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal customer data beyond what is already available in Zendesk\n- **No Financial Data Storage**: Payment transactions occur directly between the customer's wallet and the agent's Lightning address. Zapdesk does not process, store, or have access to any payment information\n- **Zendesk Sandbox**: The app runs entirely within Zendesk's secure iframe sandbox using the ZAF v2 framework\n- **Open Source**: Full source code is available at https://github.com/knowall-ai/zendesk-zapdesk for transparency and security review\n- **No External Services**: The app does not communicate with external servers or third-party services\n- **Minimal Permissions**: Only accesses necessary Zendesk data (ticket ID, assignee, current user) through the official ZAF SDK",
