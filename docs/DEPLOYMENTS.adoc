== Deployments

=== CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for automated building and releasing.

**Workflow: Build and Release** (`.github/workflows/Build and Release.yml`)

**Triggers:**
* On every push to `main` branch
* On every pull request to `main` branch

**On Pull Requests:**
* Installs dependencies
* Builds the application
* Verifies build artifacts (checks for `manifest.json`)
* Uploads build artifacts for review (retained for 7 days)

**On Push to Main:**
* Performs all the above steps, PLUS:
* Reads version from `package.json`
* Creates `zapdesk-{version}.zip` package
* Automatically publishes a GitHub release with the zip file attached
* Release includes installation instructions and links to documentation

**Creating an Automated Release:**

```bash
# 1. Update version in package.json
npm version patch  # or minor, or major

# 2. Commit and push to main
git add package.json
git commit -m "Bump version to x.x.x"
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build, package, and create a release at:
`https://github.com/knowall-ai/zendesk-zapdesk/releases`

**Download Release:**
* Navigate to the Releases page
* Download `zapdesk-{version}.zip`
* Install directly to Zendesk using the zip file

=== Build Process

**Development Build:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

**Production Build:**

```bash
# Clean previous builds
npm run clean

# Build optimized production assets
npm run build

# Package Zendesk app
zcli apps:package
```

**Build Output:**

* `/dist/assets/iframe.html` - Main application entry point
* `/dist/assets/app.js` - Bundled JavaScript (React + TypeScript)
* `/dist/assets/app.css` - Compiled CSS styles
* `/dist/manifest.json` - Zendesk app manifest
* `/dist/translations/` - Localization files
* `zapdesk-{version}.zip` - Packaged app for upload

=== Environment Deployment

**Zendesk Sandbox Environment:**

1. Build the application with `npm run build`
2. Package the app with `zcli apps:package`
3. Upload to Zendesk Sandbox:
   ```bash
   zcli apps:create dist/
   ```
4. Test in Zendesk sandbox ticket sidebar
5. Verify ZAF client integration
6. Test all payment workflows

**Zendesk Production Environment:**

**Option 1: Using GitHub Release (Recommended)**

1. Complete UAT testing in Sandbox
2. Obtain deployment approval from stakeholders
3. Download the release zip from GitHub Releases page:
   ```
   https://github.com/knowall-ai/zendesk-zapdesk/releases
   ```
4. Schedule deployment window (low-traffic hours recommended)
5. Create backup of current production app version
6. Upload new version to production:
   ```bash
   zcli apps:update --path zapdesk-{version}.zip
   ```
7. Verify deployment success
8. Perform smoke testing in production
9. Monitor for errors in first 24 hours
10. Notify end-users of new version

**Option 2: Manual Build and Deploy**

1. Complete UAT testing in Sandbox
2. Obtain deployment approval from stakeholders
3. Build locally: `npm run build`
4. Schedule deployment window (low-traffic hours recommended)
5. Create backup of current production app version
6. Upload new version to production:
   ```bash
   zcli apps:update --path dist/
   ```
7. Verify deployment success
8. Perform smoke testing in production
9. Monitor for errors in first 24 hours
10. Notify end-users of new version

=== Configuration Management

**App Settings (manifest.json):**

```json
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "private_comments",
      "type": "checkbox",
      "required": false,
      "default": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Parameter Description:**

* `private_comments`: When enabled, tip confirmation comments are posted as internal notes (visible to agents only). When disabled, comments are public (visible to requester and agents).

=== Version Management

**Versioning Strategy:**

* **Major version (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes, major feature releases
* **Minor version (0.X.0)**: New features, non-breaking changes
* **Patch version (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes, minor updates

**Automated Version Bumping:**

```bash
# Patch release (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) - Bug fixes
npm version patch

# Minor release (1.0.0 → 1.1.0) - New features
npm version minor

# Major release (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) - Breaking changes
npm version major

# Commit and push (triggers automated release)
git push origin main
```

The `npm version` command automatically:
* Updates the version in `package.json`
* Creates a git commit with the version change
* Creates a git tag (e.g., `v1.0.1`)

**Changelog Maintenance:**

* Document all changes in `CHANGELOG.md`
* Include migration notes for breaking changes
* Reference GitHub issues/pull requests
* Provide upgrade instructions

**Release Process:**

1. Update version using `npm version [patch|minor|major]`
2. Push to main branch: `git push origin main`
3. Push the tag: `git push origin --tags`
4. GitHub Actions automatically creates the release
5. Download the release zip from GitHub Releases page
6. Deploy to Zendesk using the downloaded zip file

=== Monitoring and Maintenance

**Application Health Monitoring:**

* Monitor ZAF client errors via browser console
* Track payment success/failure rates
* Track ticket posting errors
* Monitor app load times and performance

**User Feedback Collection:**

* Monitor Zendesk app reviews and ratings
* Collect user feedback via support channels
* Track feature requests and enhancement ideas
* Analyze usage patterns and adoption metrics

**Maintenance Schedule:**

* **Weekly**: Review error logs and user feedback
* **Monthly**: Dependency updates and security patches
* **Quarterly**: Feature releases and major updates
* **As needed**: Critical bug fixes and security updates

=== Rollback Procedures

**Emergency Rollback:**

1. Identify critical issue requiring rollback
2. Notify stakeholders of rollback decision
3. Restore previous version from backup:
   ```bash
   zcli apps:update --path backup/zapdesk-{previous-version}.zip
   ```
4. Verify rollback successful
5. Communicate rollback to users
6. Investigate root cause of issue
7. Plan hotfix or corrected deployment

**Rollback Validation:**

* Test core functionality after rollback
* Verify settings are preserved
* Check user data integrity
* Monitor for additional errors

=== Multi-Language Support

Zapdesk includes automatic language detection and localization based on Zendesk user preferences.

==== Supported Languages

* **English** (`en`) - Default language
* **Spanish** (`es`) - Full translation

==== How It Works

The app automatically:

1. Fetches the current user's locale from Zendesk (`currentUser.locale`)
2. Loads the appropriate translation file from `/dist/translations/`
3. Falls back to English if the language is not supported
4. Handles locale variants (e.g., `es-MX` → `es` → `en`)

==== Testing Language Changes

**For Administrators:**

To test different languages:

1. Log into Zendesk with admin account
2. Click profile icon (top right) → **View profile**
3. Click **Edit profile**
4. Change **Language** to desired language (e.g., Español)
5. Click **Save**
6. Reload any ticket page
7. Open Zapdesk app in sidebar - it will display in the selected language

**For End Users:**

Each end user's language preference is automatically detected. Users can change their language:

1. In Zendesk, click profile icon → **My profile**
2. Change **Language** preference
3. The app will automatically display in their selected language

==== Technical Implementation

**Translation Files:**

* Location: `/translations/en.json`, `/translations/es.json`
* Format: Nested JSON structure
* Loading: Dynamic import at runtime based on user locale

**Console Debugging:**

When the app loads, check browser console for:

```
[Zapdesk] User locale: es
[i18n] Loading translations for locale: es
[i18n] Loaded translations: es
```

==== Adding New Languages

To add support for additional languages:

1. **Create Translation File:**
   * Copy `translations/en.json` to `translations/{locale}.json`
   * Translate all text values (keep keys identical)
   * Maintain the same JSON structure

2. **Update Manifest:**
   * Edit `manifest.json`
   * Add locale to `supportedLocales` array:
   ```json
   "supportedLocales": ["en", "es", "fr"]
   ```

3. **Test:**
   * Build the app: `npm run build`
   * Verify translation file is in `dist/translations/`
   * Change Zendesk user language to test

4. **Deploy:**
   * Package and upload to Zendesk
   * Verify locale detection in console logs

**Important Notes:**

* Browser language settings do NOT affect the app
* Language is determined by Zendesk user profile setting
* Translation changes require rebuilding and redeploying the app
* All translation keys must match between language files
